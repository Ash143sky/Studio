<body>  <h3>Studio Ghibli has been gently revolutionizing the animation world since 1986, combining an endearing <br>
     and empathetic worldview with rousing adventure. That was the year of their debut feature, Castle in the Sky, <br>
    which heralded the superstar team of Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata. (Nausicaa, which we’re including <br>
    on this list, was made before Ghibli’s founding but has been culturally adopted as part of of filmography.) <br>
    Miyazaki has been Studio Ghibli’s global champion, and rounded out the rest of the ’80s with My Neighbor <br>
    Totoro and Kiki’s Delivery Service. And it wasn’t long before producer Takahata wore the director’s hat, <br>
    crafting the somber Grave of the Fireflies, which played as a double feature with Totoro in Japan. <br>
